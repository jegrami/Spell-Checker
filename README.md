# Spell-Checker

This litle program asks users for a word, then it returns the correct version if the word is misspelled.
Please try it--and hit star if you like it.
This is my first real program, though it's just a function.

If you wish to help improve this function, please do. 
I can't seem to figure out how to get the fuction to continue asking for a word if the user enters the correct spelling.

Please fork this repo, and help me out!
